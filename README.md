# Wii Sports Resorts Swordplay in Minecraft
Wii Sports Plugin for Minecraft Spigot

Currently only includes the Wii Sports Swordplay Mini Game

Very early beta, code buggy, messy and probably doesn't fully work
Requires NoteBlockAPI

Contributions are welcome but I don't know who would want to read and work on this code
